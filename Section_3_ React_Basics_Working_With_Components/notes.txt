npx create-react-app app-name giving dependency error on npm v8
npm audit fix or npm audit fix -force did not solve issue
running npx create-react-app app-name with --legacy-peer-deps also did now work
downgraded to npm v6 using: npm install -g npm@6
running npx create-react-app app-name with npmv6 also did not solve the issue

Solution: remove special characters from the folder name

JSX -> JavaScript XML
JSX produces React "elements". Instead of artificially separating technologies (js and html) by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns* with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

ex.: const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

*separation of concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections. Each section addresses a separate concern**,

**In CS Concern is a particular set of information that has an effect on the code of a computer program. A concern can be as general as "the details of the hardware for an application", or as specific as "the name of which class to instantiate".

Declarative Approach: define the desired target state and let React figure out the actual JS DOM instructions.

Declarative programming focus on the end result, imperative programming focuses on how to get there.
